This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2591

Automatically closes HTML tag once you finish typing it with >. It is also smart enough to not autoclose tags when in a comment, when they are self-closing, or when they have already been closed.

So, <body id="foo">, upon typing >, will become <body id="foo">|</body>, where | is the cursor.
But, if you type <img src="bar.png">, the script knows to keep it the same.
