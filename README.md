# vimrc
My personal .vimrc file shared in case it might be useful to others. Included in my .vimrc are many vim plugins that I find to be useful. I use Vundle to manage them. Below are links to all of my plugins

* [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim): Package manager that keeps my plugin files in order and up to date
* [Molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai): Awesome color scheme, and my personal favorite
* [Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline): Makes the vim status bar infinitely more useful. Requires a patched font to look pretty though
* [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): Directory manager for vim. Adds a GUI-like file sidebar similar to many modern IDEs
* [NERDTree Tabs](https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs): Makes NERDTree more useful and user friendly. Also makes it behave better
* [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic): Unbelievably useful syntax checker.
* [delimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate): Automatically insert matching things like brackets and parantheses
* [vim-better-whitespace](https://github.com/ntpeters/vim-better-whitespace): Not necessary per se, but for people who hate unnecessary whitespace it's very necessary
* [NERDCommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter): Adds a lot of the commenting functionality you would expect from a modern IDE

I left the descriptions for each plugin fairly brief for a reason. I highly encourage anyone who uses any of these plugins to follow the links and read their official documentation, because they can explain themselves better than I can. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about my .vimrc, and I'm also open to tips and suggestions as to what I could do to further improve it. I've only been using vim for a few months and still have a lot to learn.
