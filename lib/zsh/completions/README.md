### Completions

Add files to this directory for custom completion definitions within your environment.

Files should be named in the format `_<command_name>`.

For example, if you have `bitwarden-cli` installed, you can save its completions like so:
```zsh
bw completion --shell zsh > $DOTFILES/lib/zsh/completions/_bw
```
